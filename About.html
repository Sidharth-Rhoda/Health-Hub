					<p><b>Fitness Hub has been serving as Gym since 1993 and is considered to be the “Cheers” of fitness.</b></p>
					<p><i>Because we truly do know your name. It is the longest running independently owned full-service gym in D.C. Our unique gym combines the personal attention and member service of a boutique gym with the fitness options of a large club including full service locker rooms with all the amenities, filtered water fountain, and our beautiful Zen Garden Deck.</i></p>
					<p><i>Our beginnings go back to 1983 when Fit Physique, Inc. was founded to provide on-site fitness programs. Although at the time this was considered to be a novel idea, corporate fitness has only continued to grow and our on-site programs exist throughout the city to this day. In 1987, with the opening of the Fit Physique Exercise Studio, aerobic classes expanded to include step, body sculpting and yoga.</i></p>
